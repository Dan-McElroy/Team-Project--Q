Notes by Ross Barnie
Includes supervisor and team meeting notes.

Daniel is lead programmer so he should be the one to divvy up tasks.

What are the tasks?
	- UI, add consistency
		- add progress bar to the top
	- search algorithms
	- rule checks

Netbeans vs Eclipse
	- We will use Netbeans

Until we have a working prototype, no point in looking at animation

February 15th is the lab day
February 8th - should have working prototype
