\begin{itemize}
  \item{
    There are inconsistencies in the interface when in
    full-screen. Some of it looks terrible, others seem to resize with
    no problems.
  }
  \item{
    The user guide was confusing people because of the explanation of
    how to run the program.
    There is no need to save the application (it can be run from
    clicking the link on moodle) and the explanation of running from
    Unix-based machines was confusing Windows users.
  }
  \item{
    There needs to be a back button on the Sequence Entry screen
    (\texttt{StartPanel.java}) so that users can see the links again.
  }
  \item{
    In Primer Selection, the Reverse button does not display correctly
    on Windows (looks like ``Reve...'')
  }
  \item{
    Highlighting should be changed so that the background colour is
    changed, rather than the text colour.
  }
  \item{
    BUG: Several people found that they would be told that their
    primers' melting temperatures were not within 3 degrees when the
    first temperature was higher than the last (most commonly 64 and 62).
  }
  \item{
    BUG: There is no check to ensure that either primers actually
    exist in the sequence.
  }
  \item{
    Pass/fail windows are ``oddly sized''.
  }
  \item{
    Two users had exactly the same primers except for one
    character. The second user had an extra `g' at the end of their
    sequence and found that they failed on self-annealing, whereas the
    first user had passed this test. 
  }
  \item{
    After primers have been entered in the text fields, the primers
    should be highlighted in the sequence.
  }
  \item{
    The user should be told where the primers anneal, if they do.
  }
\end{itemize}
