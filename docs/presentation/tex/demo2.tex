\frametitle{Demonstration Feedback}
\item Lots of varied discussion - some good, some bad
\item Users tended not to comment on parts that worked
\item Collated results, then decided what needed to be changed
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Demonstration Points}
\item Users felt program was better than paper, and layout was very functional
\item Reverse primers would dissapear - Make sure they were stored and add highlighting
\item Rules were unbreakable in system - Add an override function
\item No graphical copy/paste - add a menu with copy/paste
\item Capitalisation seemed very harsh
\item Temperature bug present in system
\item Couldn't check each primer seperately - implement buttons for this
