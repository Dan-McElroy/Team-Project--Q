\section*{Background}

The University of Glasgow's School of Life Sciences students are
required to study a course named Molecular Methods.
Some of these students are participating in degree programmes, such as
Zoology, where working at such a small scale seems irrelevant and this
attitude is reflected in student feedback surveys.
The School wishes to address this attitude and has thus asked that an
interactive system be made for a particular section of the course in
an effort to engage students and make it more interesting.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (or PCR) is a technique for amplifying, or
copying many times, a target segment of one or many DNA
(Deoxyribonucleic acid) molecules in a test tube \citep{campbell08}.
The technique is taught to students of Molecular Methods and has been
noted as one of the least engaging parts of the course to students,
so the interactive system being designed will be used as a teaching
aid for PCR.

Part of what makes this system so interesting to create is that it
will be deployed within the School in order to help teach our fellow
students, while we ourselves must learn the process well enough to be
able to implement and, more importantly, teach it.
While the educational aspect makes the system interesting to create,
it also adds to the challenge involved.
Only one member of the group had even studied Biology in secondary
school so learning these complex concepts described below has been a
huge part of the ongoing requirements gathering with the clients, Dr
Pamela Scott and Dr Nicola Veitch.

In order to understand how PCR works, so that the system can teach it,
an understanding of DNA is required.
DNA is represented by a ``strand'' or sequence of many characters
consisting of one of four characters, `\verb!a!', `\verb!t!',
`\verb!c!', or `\verb!g!'.
Since DNA is double-stranded, this strand has a ``complementary''
strand which is the same sequence but with each character replaced by
its complementary equivalent.

\begin{table}[h] 
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
      \hline
      Character & Complementary \\
      \hline
      \verb!a! & \verb!t! \\
      \verb!t! & \verb!a! \\
      \verb!g! & \verb!c! \\
      \verb!c! & \verb!g! \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{DNA characters with complementary strand equivalent}
    \label{tab:compChars}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Using table~\ref{tab:compChars}, we can note the complementary
strand of any given sequence of characters, or ``bases'' as
they are known. 
So ``atctg'', for example, is complementary to ``tagac'', and vice versa.

Of particular emphasis in the learning of PCR is the design of
``primers'' which are short sequences of twenty to thirty bases which
need to be designed to specify a target sequence.
These primers are integral to the PCR process and rules associated
with their design will be covered in greater detail later in this
report.
Primer design is the primary intended learning outcome of the system
for users so this will be the main focus of the system.

\section*{Current Systems}

At the beginning of the project we were sent three links to systems
currently in place which attempt to make learning this process more
interactive and/or visual.

The first was a video hosted on YouTube \citep{youtube:taqExtension},
made by demonstrators within the School of Life Sciences.
During its eighteen second duration, the video shows various elements
of the PCR process including change in temperature and the role of the
primer.
However, it was commented by the team and by the clients that it was
insubstantial in terms of information delivery, several of the stages
of PCR are omitted with no mention of primer design, and in terms
of interactivity.

Another video hosted on YouTube \citep{youtube:PCR}, currently referred
to on School of Life Sciences' website, is similar in style to a
lecture with slides and a voice-over which repeats the textual
information on each slide.
While this video is far more informative than the previous one, with
each stage of PCR clearly described, and with visually pleasing
animations, it lacks in explicit primer design and again in
interactivity.

Videos and multimedia in general have been questioned as teaching
aids.
Simply because the information is in video or multimedia format
does not necessarily mean that it is benefitting the learning of its
viewers, or creating the correct environment to encourage learning.
Interactivity, along with other factors, are key to engaging people to
learn \citep{gamingRedefines2004}.

Finally, an animation from the University of Utah, titled ``PCR
Virtual Lab'' \citep{genScienceCenter2012}.
This is a much more interactive experience and allows the user to use
virtual pipettes in order to simulate what you would do in a lab
situation when performing PCR.
Additionally, the information it provides, while slightly basic in the
beginning for our target users, is extensive and very informative to
the novice user, such as Biology-illiterate Computing Scientists.
While this is a much more interactive and, compared to the
alternatives described above, much more informative experience, it
fails to provide the user with the theoretical background information,
particularly on primer design, required to fully understand the
process and why the reaction occurs.
