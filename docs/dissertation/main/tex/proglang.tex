When discussing implementation, the group briefly considered a small
number of languages before quickly settling on Java as our 
implementation language. This decision was made in light of our 
collective experience with the language as a consequence of the Java 
Programming course taken in the previous academic year
\ref{javaProgramming2}, and our knowledge of existing GUI frameworks 
that would suit our purposes, described below in Section \ref{impl:ui}.
