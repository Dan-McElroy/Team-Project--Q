Before the team began implementing the application, we decided to
split the team into three smaller sub-teams, in order to maximise the
use of everyone's time.
These groups were to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and implement data models and associated custom methods
\item Implement the graphical user interface
\item Design and implement an animation to show the process of PCR
\end{itemize}

The team's lead programmer, Daniel McElroy, took the lead on this
decision and, while noting each member's particular preferences,
decided to split the team in the following way:
\begin{description}
\item[GUI]{Ross Eric Barnie, Murray Ross}
\item[Data Models and Custom Methods] {Daniel McElroy, Ross Taylor}
\item[Animation] {Dmitrijs Jonins}
\end{description}

While it may have been unnecessary to assign a team-member entirely to
the animation, the team felt that Dmitrijs would work best on his own
and meant that the rest of the team could work as they had done up to
this point, as a team.
