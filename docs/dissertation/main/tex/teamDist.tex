Before the team began implementing the application, we decided to
split the team into three smaller sub-teams, in order to maximise the
use of everyone's time.
These groups were to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and implement data models and associated custom methods;
\item Implement the graphical user interface;
\item Design and implement an animation to show the process of PCR.
\end{itemize}

The team's lead programmer, Daniel McElroy, took the lead on this
decision and, while noting each member's particular preferences,
decided to split the team in the following way:
\begin{description}
\item[GUI]{Ross Eric Barnie, Murray Ross}
\item[Data Models and Custom Methods] {Daniel McElroy, Ross Taylor}
\item[Animation] {Dmitrijs Jonins}
\end{description}

While it may have been unnecessary to assign a team-member entirely to
the animation, the team felt that because at the start of the
implementation stage Dmitrijs was out of the country for a prolonged
period of time, that it would serve the team best to give him work he
could complete in his own time.
