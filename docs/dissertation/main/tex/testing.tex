Also, with reference to the (edit ME)\cite{Lethbridge}, we accomodated for both white and black box testing. 

\subsection{White Box Testing}
White box testing was
used throughout the development of the implementation, as we all had an indepth knoweledge of the source code. This enabled us to test
for defects by creating scenarios which tested the programs to its limits and beyond, in order for us to assur
