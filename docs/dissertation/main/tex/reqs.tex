% WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING:
% FIGURES - original meeting notes - FIND THEM
%         - Dmitrijs' designs, and any others we can find

\subsubsection{Inital Requirements Gathering}
% The sheet we were presented with Meeting 1 - flow of application more 
% or less already decided
% Molecular Methods lab book
% Links to Youtube videos and Utah thang
The requirements gathering process for the application began immediately.
At the first meeting, our clients presented us with a document outlining
what it was that they wanted from the end product, including a very
early step-by-step walkthrough of the application they envisioned. This
proved to be a key tool in bringing us up to speed with what the %thing
should accomplish, and really sped up the initial requirements gathering
phase. Obviously, this design was altered and adapted throughout the
project, but the steps served to provide a rough guidline that we
followed throughout development.

Along with this document, we were given the Molecular Methods lab book,
in order to see how Primer Design is currently taught in the course.
% TALK ABOUT MOL METHODS BOOK, WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED.

Finally, within the first two or three meetings we were sent links to
various multimedia teaching tools for Primer Design, as described in
Section \ref{intro:currentSystems}. Along with our own research, this
gave us an informed view of what else is out there, the positives and
negatives of these current approaches, and what we could improve upon
in our own product.
 
% Probably more, dunno.

\subsubsection{Design Feedback}
% Weekly meetings, reaffirming theory behind PCR and primer design
% Produced several versions of user interface mockups
Throughout the project, we maintained a weekly meeting schedule with our
supervisor and clients, and despite scheduling difficulties at least one
of the clients was present at every one of these meetings. This allowed
us the opportunity to improve our design iteratively through multiple
pitches, internalising the feedback given over the following week to 
produce a design more in line with their requirements. 

\subsubsection{Implementation Feedback}
% At weekly meetings during implementation, gave repeated demonstrations
% Clients were always more than happy to provide a number of suggestions
% and improvements in keeping with the requirements of the product.
