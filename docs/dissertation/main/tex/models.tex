- 3 objects, Sequence, Primer, TestResult

Basic in construction, all classes have toStrings and booleans.

Sequence:
2 strings to represent each strand of the sequence, ints to represent the start and end of the desired PART of that sequence, 2 Primer objects.

Complement method taking a base and returning its complement, isUnique tests if primer is unique (durr), tempDifference compares the temperature
of both primers, primerTest combines all methods that return a TestResult and produce an overall TestResult, the toString of which should be
shown in the Primer Evaluation Dialog.

Primer:
Basically a class to test user primers, string to represent this primer, and all primer tests methods, each returning a test result. Method named
test() adds all of these TestResults together when run against the code String, and returns a larger TestResult to be used both in the individual 
primer checks and in Sequence's primerTest method.

TestResult:
A class to format output of one or multiple primer tests. Uses an enum called PassState with three states, PASS, FAIL, CLOSEFAIL, indicating
the outcome of a particular test. An ArrayList of these Pass States is used to keep track of all individual results, and an ArrayList of Strings
contains each test's corresponding message.

Methods used to add TestResults together and access or mutate various elements of the ArrayLists.
