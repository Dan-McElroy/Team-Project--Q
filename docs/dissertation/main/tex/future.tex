We don't plan to develop the project further unless asked and given specific suggestions by the Biology Department. We believe the application is sufficiently presentable and working adequately. If, however, an important imlementation or design flaw is surfaced in subsequent student testing, we will do our best to resolve the issue. One obvious part that could be improved is the animation, as it can now be made in Flash or other platform more suitable for static animations, whhich would make the animation more aesthetically advanced. However, it would require a lot of time resources used for the new platform familiarisation as well as the development itself, so we decided it is not worth it right now.
