We introduce the things the here!

\section{Project Outline}
\paragraph{Successes}
% Technical state (robust)
% Meets all requirements
% User satisfaction
% Client relations - maintaining a schedule/rapport
\begin{itemize}
\item Technical state of the application. The version of the system thhat
  we submitted to the clients for evaluation by the students, while lacking
  some of the features we plan to implement, is fully featured, has been
  tested on all common operating systems and has only shown two minor problems.
\item Satisfaction of intended users. When we released the program to the
  students (who, despite %being further in the course
  represented our userbase %accurately),
  we found that the majority of users were pleased with the application, and
  found that their understanding of primer design had been improved as a result
  of its use.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Failures}
% Lack of organisation
% Devoted too much time to it
% Some minor bugs still to be ironed out
% Late beginning of implementation - holidays largely unproductive
\begin{itemize}
\item Testy!
\end{itemize}
