\section{About}

This document will outline how to use the, provisionally named,
PrimerDesign application created for use by students of Molecular
Methods to learn about Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) and primer
design. 

If you encounter any problems while using the application, feel free
to ask your tutor, or email us at \url{TeamProjectQ@gmail.com}.

\section{Getting Started}

You will need:
\begin{itemize}
\item{An operating system capable of running Java (you should not need
    to worry about this as Java runs on almost all modern Windows,
    Linux and Macintosh operating systems)
\item{a web browser (such as Google Chrome or Mozilla
Firefox)}
\item{Java (at least version 6) installed on your computer (most modern computers have
    Java, but if not it is freely available online from Oracle)}
\item{Access to the Molecular Methods moodle site by the School of
    Life Sciences at University of Glasgow}
\item{An internet connection (unless you have downloaded the
    application already)}
\end{itemize}

With that we can get started!

First, download the file PrimerDesign.jar from the Molecular Methods
moodle site and save it somewhere on your computer.
Next, double-click on the PrimerDesign.jar file you just saved (note
that Unix-based operating systems such as MacOS or Linux can run the
file using the following terminal command:
\begin{center}
\verb£$ java -jar PrimerDesign£
\end{center}
If you encounter problems here, ensure that you have Java installed on
your computer.
