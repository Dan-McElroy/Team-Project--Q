\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Identification}

This document outlines the Requirements Specification of the
Interactive Primer Design system required by the clients. See section
\ref{sec:extendedDefinition} for the definition of the problem the
system will solve.

\subsection{Purpose and Description of Document}

This document will serve as an agreement between the client and Team
Q as to the requirements of the system. Any disagreement between the
two parties regarding these requirements will be documented here along
with details on how this was resolved.

\subsection{Document Status and Schedule}

Currently this document is in draft and scheduled to be finalised
pending review and approval from the clients on 7th November 2012.

The next draft of this document (version 1.1) will include all notes from group
meetings and client meetings taken by Team Q and will be included in
appendix \ref{sec:clientMeetingDocs}.
Any changes requested by the clients will also be added for this version.

After which the document will be updated iteratively as changes
arise and will be re-approved by the clients before being re-released.

\section{Extended Problem Defintion}
\label{sec:extendedDefinition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Molecular Biology students are required to learn PCR and Primer
techniques as part of their 3rd year curriculum. 
This system being designed will allow students to use the application
to test their knowledge of these concepts. 
Users will access the NCBI database and copy and paste a DNA section
into the application. 
The system will then tell them if this is the correct seqenence. 
Users will then be asked to select which lines of DNA code they would
like to use for the PCR product. 
Once this has been selected, they shall pick a forward primer pair and
backward primer pair. 
Once these have been selected, various help methods will appear to
help the user pick the right one. 
Once correct primer pairs have been picked, the melting temperature of
both primers will be calculated and displayed on screen.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{System Scope}

The main aim of this system is to act as a teaching tool to aid students
in learning how to design primers for PCR experiments and should be
usable in a teaching environment or by people on their home computers.

It should function as an interactive, step-by-step guide through the
process of PCR on a DNA sequence of the users choice. The user is
required to access the NCBI website and copy and paste their choice of
DNA sequence into the system. The system should provide feedback if the
user enters incorrect primers. The system should then check if the
melting temperatures of the primers are in the required range. The user
is then given a link to perform primer blast to check if the primers
they have chosen are unique.

The system should also provide the user help with completing each task
by providing relevant rules for each task and giving the user
instructions about how to use websites and resources outwith the system
(NCBI, primer blast etc.).

When the user has provided an appropriate pair of primers the system
will then show an animation of the PCR reaction taking place.

\section{Non Functional Requirements}

%Describe the non-functional requirements for the system here, giving a
%rationale (traceable to your requirements gathering) for each.  You
%will need to think about how to group/structure requirements in this
%section.

\begin{itemize}
\item{
The system is expected to be used at students' homes or in the Biology
lab computers, so portability is essential for the system to work to
the clients' expectations.

%Any evidence you gathered from stakeholders relevant to your
%requirements description.  You don't need to include everything
%verbatim here, but summary documents, for example, identifying the key
%points you identified (particularly if they relate to requirements
%conflicts) can be useful.
