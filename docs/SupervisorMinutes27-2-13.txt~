Minutes from 27/2/2013

Present Team Members- Ross Taylor, Ross Barnie, Daniel McElroy
Present Staff- Nicola Veitch, Gethin Norman

-Should have a button/working hyperlink on first page (Ross Barnie later pointed out that this has been tried multiple times and may not be possible.)
-Change "Further Reading" to "Resources" on first page.
-Nicola pointed out that the colours we used for the primer evaluation screen are not colour-blind friendly, decide the best thing to do is to add the PASS/FAIL/BORDERLINE tags back into the strings to display.
-Nicola also pointed out a bug in the colour coded evaluation pages and said she would email us if she could recreate it.
-Timing on the animation is too fast -> should be changed to purely button clicks.
-Also, animation: would be nice to have the actual temperature next to the thermometer.
-Also, remove black box from animation
-Should have a link on second page to NCBI as that is the page it is used on.
-Change reverse primer highlighting to green
-SUPER AMBITIOUS: Highlight primers on double stranded view. (not going to happen, probably).
-missing space on pairanneal check.
-Need a tooltip for reverse button.
-First line on temp panel not correct if user has chosen "Accept + Continue"
-Need to implement some alternative to Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V for copying primers. ********************* Needed before given to students.
-Unicode characters from evaluation dialogue not displaying properly.
-In animation: the GCAT key is next to thermometer no longer needed since bases dont actually match anyway.
-"It would be nice" to have some indication at the top of the screen during the animation of what stage/phase the process is at.
-It was decided that Monday 4th March will be our cut-off date for making changes to the project before it is given to students for feedback. This means that we need to finalise the feedback questionnaire for Friday 1st March.
-It was suggested that we come up with a list of essential tasks which need to be completed for Monday.
-It was also suggested that we make sure the questionnaire is not too long.
