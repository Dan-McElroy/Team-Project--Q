Organisational Changes
----------------------

Ross Barnie and Daniel McElroy changed roles as of week 4 of the
project.
Ross was made librarian and Daniel was made Lead Programmer.
This was decided based on Ross's familiarity with the documentation
after producing D1 and after extended use of the trac project
management tool.
Daniel was chosen as lead programmer after the group decided one would
be needed when implementation began.
